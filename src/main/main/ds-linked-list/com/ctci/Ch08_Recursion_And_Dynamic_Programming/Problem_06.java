/**
 * <br> Problem Statement :
 * <p>
 * In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi,
 * you have 3 towers and disks of different sizes
 * which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts
 * with disks sorted in ascending order of size from
 * top to bottom (i.e each disk sits on top of an even
 * larger one). You have the following constraints,
 * 1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
 * 2. A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto another tower.
 * 3. A disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
 * <p>
 * Write a program to move the disks from 1st tower to 3rd tower using stacks.

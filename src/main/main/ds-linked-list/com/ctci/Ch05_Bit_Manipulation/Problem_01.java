/**
 * <br> Problem Statement :
 * <p>
 * You are given two 32 bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions,
 * i and j. Write a method to insert M into N such that M starts at
 * bit j and ends at bit i. You can assume that bits j through i have
 * enough space to fit all of M. That is, if M = 10011, you can assume
 * that there are at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not for example,
 * have j = 3 and i = 2, because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.
 * <p>
 * Example :
 * Input N = 10000000000, M = 10011, i = 2, j = 6
 * Output N = 10001001100

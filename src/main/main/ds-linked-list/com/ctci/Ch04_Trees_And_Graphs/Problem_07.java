/**
 * <br> Problem Statement :
 * <p>
 * You are given a list of project and list of dependencies (which
 * is a list of pairs of projects, where second project is dependent
 * on the first project). All of the project's dependencies must be
 * build before project is built. Find the build order that will
 * allow projects to be built. If there is no valid build order,
 * return an error.
 * <p>
 * Example :
 * Input :
 * projects : a, b, c, d, e, f
 * dependencies : (a, d), (f, b), (b, d), (f, a), (d, c)
 * Output : f, e, a, b, d, c
 *

    /* There is a significant difference between these 3 which is defined below :
     * 	1. final - This keyword is used with a variable or class to make sure it is not changeable
     * 		For ex. final when used with a variable (primitive) makes sure it's value doesn't gets changed.
     * 				final when used with a variable (reference) makes sure that variable doesn't point to any other object in same heap.
     *
     * 	2. finally - This is used with try catch block and ensures it gets executed even if try block has a break or a return statement.
     * 		This even gets executed when there is a exception. This is mainly used to close any open connections, open input streams etc.
     *
     * 	3. finalize - This is used by the garbage collector once it ensures that no reference for a variable exists furthermore. */

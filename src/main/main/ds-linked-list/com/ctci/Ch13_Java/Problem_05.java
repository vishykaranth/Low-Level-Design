    /* All of these are sub classes of Map and all of them deals with
     * key value pairs giving some way to iterate over the keys. The way
     * all of these behaves is similar but they differ in their lookup time
     * and the way they store key value pairs .
     * Below is a differentiation :
     *
     * 	1. HashMap : This offers O(1) for lookup of keys and insertion. But there is no sort order
     * 		maintained for this. This is implemented by arrays of Linked List (which is now changed
     * 		to Tree in java 8)
     *
     * 	2. TreeMap : This offers O(log N) for lookup and insertion. Order is maintained in this so key
     * 		must implement a comparable interface. This is implemented using Red-Black trees.
     *
     * 	3. LinkedHashMap : This again offers O(1) for lookup and insertion. Order is maintained in this
     * 		but in the same way as insertion happens. This is implemented using doubly linked lists.
     *
     * When to use :
     * 	- Use HashMap unless there is a strict need to use something else. HashMap provides very fast lookup.
     * 		TreeMap is used when we want to maintain a specific order. for example you need to fetch first
     * 		10 name of students who start with a given alphabet. LinkedHashMap can be used in case of caching
     * 		where you want to remove the last element. */

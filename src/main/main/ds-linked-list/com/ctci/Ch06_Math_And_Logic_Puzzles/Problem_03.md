**Problem Statement :**

There is an 8x8 chess board in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off. You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exactly two squares. Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board? Prove your answer (by providing an example or showing why it's impossible).

**Answer :**

It is impossible to do that because one dominos needs 2 squares and in first and last columns we have just 7 squares left. We can place 3 dominos but one square will be unused and will disturb the entire symmetry of board.

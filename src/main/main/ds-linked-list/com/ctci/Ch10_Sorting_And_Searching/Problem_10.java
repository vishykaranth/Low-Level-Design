/**
 * <br> Problem Statement :
 * <p>
 * Imagine you are reading in a stream of integers. Periodically,
 * you wish to be able to look up the rank of a number x (the number
 * of values less then or equal to x). Implement the data structure
 * and algorithms to support these operations. That is, implement
 * the method track(int x), which is called when each number is
 * generated, and the method getRankOfNumber(int x), which returns the
 * number of values less then or equal to x (not including x itself).
 * <p>
 * Example :
 * Stream (in order of appearance) : 5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 9, 7, 13, 3
 * getRankOfNumber(1) = 0
 * getRankOfNumber(3) = 1
 * getRankOfNumber(4) = 3
 *

/**
 * <br> Problem Statement :
 * <p>
 * Given a sorted array of n integers that has been
 * rotated an unknown number of times. Write code to
 * find an element in the array. You may assume that
 * array was originally sorted in increasing order.
 * <p>
 * Example : Input : find 5 in {15, 16, 19, 20, 25, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14}
 * Output : 8 (index of 5 in array)

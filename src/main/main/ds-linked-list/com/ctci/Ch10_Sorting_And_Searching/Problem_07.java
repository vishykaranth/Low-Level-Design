/**
 * <br> Problem Statement :
 * <p>
 * Given a input file with 4 billion non- negative
 * integers, provide an algorithm to generate an
 * integer that is not contained in the file. Assume
 * you have 1 GB of memory available for this task.
 * <p>
 * FOLLOW UP : What if you have only 10 MB of memory?
 * Assume that all the values are distinct and we now
 * have no more than one billion non-negative integers.

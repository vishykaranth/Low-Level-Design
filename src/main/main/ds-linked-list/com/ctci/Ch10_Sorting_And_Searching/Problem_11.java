/**
 * <br> Problem Statement :
 * <p>
 * In an array of integers, a "peak" is an element which
 * is greater then or equal to the adjacent integers and
 * a "valley" is an element which is less then or equal
 * to the adjacent integers. For example in the array,
 * {5, 8, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6}, {8, 6} are the peaks and {5, 2}
 * are the valleys. Given an array of integers, sort the
 * array into an alternating sequence of peaks and valleys.
 * <p>
 * Example :
 * Input : {5, 3, 1, 2, 3}
 * Output : {5, 1, 3, 2, 3}
 *

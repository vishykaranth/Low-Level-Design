/**
 * <br> Problem Statement :
 * <p>
 * You are given an array like data structure "Listy"
 * which lacks a size() method. It does, however, have
 * an elementAt(i) method that returns the element at
 * index i in O(1) time. If i is beyond the bound of the
 * data structure, it returns -1 (For this reason, data
 * structure only supports positive integers). Given a "Listy"
 * which contains positive sorted integers, find the index
 * at which an element x occurs. If x occurs multiple times
 * you may return any index.

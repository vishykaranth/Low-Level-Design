/**
 * <br> Problem Statement :
 * <p>
 * Othello is played as follows :
 * Each Othello piece is white on one side and black on other.
 * When a piece is surrounded by its opponent on both the left
 * and right sides, or both the top and bottom, it is said to
 * be captured and it's color is flipped. On your turn, you must
 * capture at least one of the component's pieces. The game ends
 * when either user has no more valid moved. The win is assigned
 * to the person with the most pieces. Implement the object oriented
 * design for Othello.
